# CI-CD-for-Test-Automation-JenkinsGitHub-Actions

## Setup Instructions

**PowerShell Configuration:**
```powershell

## Areas for improvement:

While you identified types of tests, elaborating on how CI provides self-check abilities through automated processes could further strengthen your foundational understanding.
When discussing test automation strategy, exploring concepts like parallel execution and test data management could provide a more comprehensive view.

Areas for improvement:

Further exploration of the specific benefits of cloud-hosted vs. self-hosted CI/CD tools.
Deeper understanding of why explicit Node.js setup is crucial in GitHub Actions.
Elaborating on the 'on demand' and customization aspects of Docker for Jenkins.

Areas for improvement:

While you understood the concept of a configuration file, remember that Jenkins pipelines are typically defined in a Jenkinsfile (using Groovy syntax), not a generic YAML file like Docker Compose.
When discussing the 'Build' stage, ensure you clearly articulate the transformation of source code into a usable artifact through compilation and dependency installation.
